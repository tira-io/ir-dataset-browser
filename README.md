## Setup Your Development Environment

We use [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for development. To start your environment, either use Github Codespaces (click on "Code" -> "Codespaces" in Github to open one) as the easiest way to get started or [devpod](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod) as open source alternative (directly pointing to our Kubernetes or your local docker installation).
